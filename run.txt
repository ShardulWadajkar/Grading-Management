Hello!
This was my first time making a frontend for anything, so its crude, but all the sql queries
given to us work.
First you will have to install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ incase you dont
have it.
While installing, select add python to path.
If you are using python3, run
pip3 install mysql-connector-python on your terminal.
else use
pip install mysql-connector-python
This downloads the necessary libraries to run these files.

Then in your MySql WorkBench, open the sql files from this zip folder and run the files create tables
and sample data to have something to use this app from.

Then you have to just add your connection details in the files loginpage.py(line 9-11), 
admin_homepage.py(line 10-12), teacher_homepage.py(line 10-12) and student_homepage.py(line 10-12).

You are all set to go. Run the file loginpage.py.
Sample logins:
username = P050, password = SB050
username = P042, password = PI024
username = P001, password = SD001
